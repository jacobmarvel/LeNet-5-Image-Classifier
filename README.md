# LeNet-5 Image Classifier

This repository contains an implementation of the classic LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network using Keras. The model is built to classify 28x28 grayscale images into one of ten categories.

## Model Architecture

The network consists of the following layers:
- Two sets of convolutional and average pooling layers for feature extraction.
- Flatten layer to transform the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- Three fully connected layers, culminating in a 10-unit softmax layer for classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
